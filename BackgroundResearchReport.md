“Old Woman Creek National Estuarine Research Reserve is part of a network of 28 coastal reserves connected nationally through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to address state and regional coastal management needs through research, education, and stewardship”. 
Located in Huron, Ohio, it is one of the few examples of state’s natural existing estuary. It is also an Ohio State Nature Preserve. The estuary also serves as a field laboratory where scientists and students studies this naturally functioning system. “The reserve is a cooperative partnership between the Ohio Department of Natural Resources and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration”. To protect the Old Woman Creek estuary, the sanctuary is managed by ODNR’s Division of Natural Areas and Preserves. The Natural Areas Act was enacted by the state of Ohio in 1970 and authorized ODNR to accept any dedication of public and privately owned lands as nature preserves. 
“Planning, acquisition and protection of the Old Woman Creek Estuary as a National Estuarine Sanctuary and State Nature Preserve has been a seven year effort by a multitude of individuals, organizations and agencies at local, state, and national levels. 
“The basic goal is to preserve as much of the Old Woman Creek Estuary and its watershed as possible so that information can be gained which will aid in future management decisions concerning coastal zone”, and the secondary benefit associated with it is “the preservation of habitats for estuarine-dependent flora and fauna, including endangered species; and low intensity recreation, as long as that activity does not detract from the major purposes outlined above. 
The mission of the Old Woman Creek estuary is to “promote public awareness and appreciation of the uniqueness of the estuary and supports stewardship programs that sustain the ecological integrity of Old Woman Creek”. The estuary serves as an ecological line of defense and it filters out sediments and pollutants that flow off the land into the water. The main focus of the Old Woman Creek Estuary is a long-term protection of a freshwater estuary. 
“As a transition zone between land and Lake Erie, Old Woman Creek State Nature Preserve and National Estuarine Research brings together many kinds of life. Birds, mammals, fish reptiles, amphi9bians, and insects are drawn here. A visitors center offers exceptional learning exhibits. It also offers large parking area, trails, restrooms, drinking fountain, checklist and observation area. The public is welcomed and trails are open sunrise-sunset. 

With an availability of a visitor center on site, several research projects are conducted at this site. There are over 300 species of birds that are recorded on this vicinity. 

The ecosystem features diverse habitats of marshlands, sand beaches, and upland forests, supporting plants and animals unique to natural coastal communities. This area is a habitat for nearly 300 bird species (including bald eagles), 40 fish species, and hundreds of native plants. 
Old Woman Creek is Ohio’s only national estuarine sanctuary and became a state nature preserve in 1980.
“There is an active Bald Eagle nest, and a good variety and numbers of waterfowl use the estuary seasonally. Shorebird numbers and diversity can be good along the beach, and migrating songbirds 
There are currently 8 active citizen science monitoring initiatives.
Listed below are some of the monitoring processes they used to monitor the species there and how they record them. 

### Old Woman Creek Avian Monitoring: ###

They have avian monitoring points to monitor birds activities. They have four such points. 

They collect avian monitoring data as a volunteer will come up to one of these points and the volunteer will stand for 15 minutes and they record in the sheet anything they see or hear in the 50 meters radius. 
They uses four letter avian codes to record the names for the species of the beard they see or hear.  
They have four different habitat types represented on the four different trails. 
The first habitat type is the blue trail or Estuary overlook trail. The second is the green trail or shrub/scrub forest. The third is the red trail or upland forest and the fourth is the purple trail or the prairie. Therefore, the birds are going to be in different places depending on their habitat preferences. 

### Eagle data: ###

They also have an eagle nest on the premises. The eagles are monitored using a focal scope and their nests are observed for the activities for an hour or 45 minutes depending on the preferences of the volunteer monitoring it. The weather data are also monitored such as precipitation, temperature, cloud cver, etc. 
In order to, better understand the eagle data are split into two different time frames, 1996-1999 and 2016-2018. The volunteers try to go there atleast every other day and monitor the eaglets. Its about a 3 or 4 miles of walk and then they monitor them for about an hour. They try to follow this routine in all kinds of weather, whereas, sometimes the weather condition is not so favorable. 
There is also an interesting fact about how they know how many eaglets are laid. As the size of the male eagle is smaller than the female eagles, they struggle little bit to cover their eggs if there is two or more. It is hard for the volunteers to monitor the eagle nests as they are down below and the nests are way up. However, they use all cues and experience to monitor them. 

### Beaver Monitoring: ###

It is at the back of the estuary and they have three camera traps set up at different perspectives that pictures once they sense any kind of motions. The volunteers then collect these pictures in a hope of assessing the behaviors.  The volunteers also look for sign of new activities such as chew marks on trees and record them. 

### Salamander monitoring: ###

They have fixed area for where they monitor salamanders and they have covered objects and each of these are numbered and they lift them up, check for salamanders and take the soil temperature underneath. Four times a year they take salman quarterly data which involves getting the PH of surrounding trees, soil PH, etc. and these are all used for the data analysis for salamanders.
