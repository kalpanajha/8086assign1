## Errors that I found on the three files ##
1. pond2010(1) file has missing coulumn name, which creates confusion about the data content.
2. Also in the same file there are missing values for some of the data collected.
3. zoop-temp-main file has missing temperature data.
4. Some of the data provided are in red-color, whereas others in black. Its not listed anywhere why these data are in different color.
5. The units for some of the data measurements are not provided. 
6. The graphs doesn't provide any clear understanding of what they want to represent. Also, what the horizontal and the vertical axis represents are not labeled explicitly.

## Suggestions ##

1. All Columns should be labeled properly so that it is easy to understand what they represent. 
2. Explain why the datas are missing.
3. Graphs should be plotted and labeled properly.
